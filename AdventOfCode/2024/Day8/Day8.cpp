//create antenna class
//  Includes type (char), and location (pair)
//walk through map, for each antenna type, check if already encountered, if not, add it to a vector of types
//new vector for each different antenna, stores each location
//for each pair of antenna, calculate each location of antinode
//if location in map, and not in vector of existing antinodes then add it to vector of antinodes;
